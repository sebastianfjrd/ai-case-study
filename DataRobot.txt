DataRobot: Overview and Origin

DataRobot was founded in June 2012 by Jeremy Achin (former CEO) and Thomas DeGodoy (former CTO), who were data scientists working at Travelers Insurance company at the time. [1]

The idea for DataRobot stemmed from the founders' recognition of a supply-and-demand problem in data science. They observed a shortage of skilled data scientists to meet the increasing demand for generating actionable insights from data. This led to the establishment of DataRobot as an AutoML tool to enable both expert data scientists and individuals with varying levels of machine learning knowledge to build predictive models efficiently and at a faster pace. [2]

DataRobot has a total of USD $1 Billion in funding from 47 different Investors with the latest round raised on June 29, 2021. These investments come from a mix of private and public investment companies. Additionally, DataRobot has acquired 7 different companies since its inception. [3] The company has over 1000 employees [4]

DataRobot envisions that AI will enhance various aspects of business transactions and human interactions, ultimately improving how we live, work, play, and ensure safety. They advocate for organizations to embrace Value-Driven AI as a fundamental competency to enhance their operations, growth, and optimization. [5]

DataRobot's main users consist of data scientists who are proficient in developing and deploying ML models at an accelerated pace compared to their usual workflow.
The company predominantly targets the enterprise market, attracting organizations at various stages of their AI initiatives. As of September 2022, about a third of Fortune 50 firms were among their clientele, spanning sectors such as healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and financial services.  [6]

DataRobot excels in automating ML processes, enhancing efficiency through automated data preparation, model development, time series forecasting, and deployment. What sets them apart from competitors is their unique three-step approach. 
1. They begin by identifying the customer's business issues, then reverse-engineer from the business problem to integrate technology and scientific elements. 
2. This holistic view of AI encompasses not just scientific and technological aspects but also involves the end-to-end process of building, deploying, operating, and governing AI solutions, which DataRobot seamlessly performs in unison. 
3. Moreover, their team of customer-facing data scientists assists clients in transforming their projects from concept to realization, positioning DataRobot as a frontrunner in value-oriented AI solutions. [7]

In other words, DataRobot is the leading technology company and platform innovator that brings predictive and generative AI capabilities together with the governance, observability, and security we need at scale. ESG interviewed global organizations about the economic impact of the DataRobot AI Platform and found that it could provide a 3.5x to 4.6x ROI, at up to 5x lower cost, while delivering the required capabilities up to 10x faster. The Economic Benefits of DataRobot AI Platform highlights: 83% faster operrationalization of models, 93% faster propagation of analytics capabilities to new areas across the organization, Up to 80% cost savings, compared to using exisitng resources of building new teams. [8]

In March 2023, DataRobot announced its new AI Platform 9.0 — a lifecycle platform built for predictive and generative AI with broad ecosystem interoperability. it's the only open, complete AI lifecycle platform leveraging ML that has broad interoperatbility, end-to-end capabilities for Experimentation and Production and can be deployed on-premises or in any cloud infrastructure. [9]

The platform centers around several modules:

AI Experimentation: Experiment with multiple AI problem framings, identify key drivers, and build precise models that drive impact.

AI Production: Manage, scale, and govern generative and predictive AI assets, in a a centralized control and command center.

Platform Deployment: Integrations can unify data warehouses, APIs, workflow tooling, BI tools, and business apps with the DataRobot AI Platform with a flexible delivery model.


## Landscape

DataRobot is considered to be in the Artificial Intelligence and The Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) field. The leader in Value-Driven AI a unique and collaborative approach to generative and predictive AI that combines an open platform, deep expertise and broad use-case experience to improve how organizations run, grow and optimize their business.

Some of the major trends and innovations in the AI /AutoML field have been:
- AutoML market size has grown exponentially in recent years. It will grow from $1.15 billion in 2023 and its seee exponential growth in the next few years to an estimated $7.35 billion by 2028. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to AI integration across industries, expansion of IoT and big data, rise of edge computing, hybrid cloud and on-premises solutions, regulatory compliance requirements as well. 

- Advanced Fraud Detection Drives AutoML Market growth - rising need for advanced fraud detection solutions is expected to exceed in growth of the AutoML market going forward. For example the US Government agency FinCEN which is responsible for collecting and analyzing information about financial transactions in 2021, several banking institutions sent over 350k suspicious activity reports (SARs) to finCEN to identify suspected check fraud. That's a 23% increase over the number of SARs file din 2020. This rising trend continues to grow in 2022 with over 680k reports. 

- Internet of Things (IoT) devices is expected to grow AutoML market exponentially in the near future as well. IoT devices such as physical object or devices taht are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other devices or systems over the internet. These IoT devices generate vast amounts of data that can be leveraged for insights. AutoML facilitates the development of machine learning models to extract valubale information from IoT-generated data. Some major companies operating in teh AutoML market are: Google LLC, Microsoft Corporation, Amazon Web Services Inc, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce Inc, etc. [10]

The AutoML and MLOps markets are highly fragmented. Some key players and major companies also in this AutoML Market are companies such as IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, SserviceNow, Google, AWS and Alteryx.

## Results

To name a few stables whcih DataRobot has had on the business it's their most recent recognition as a Top Vendor for Cloud-Based Data Science and machine learning Platforms by Constellation. 

DataRobot become a Unicorn since 2019 by Sellling AI Toolkits to Harried Data Scientists, what this means DataRobot wants to make machine learning so simple that a business analyst with basic training can run predictive models without breaking a sweat.

Another great example of DataRobot impact on the world it's their goal to automate as much of the traditional job of data scientists as possible. The idea is that customers come to the service with data and a business question, and the DataRobot system will turn around accurate models for a given task. For example, Laptop maker Lenovo, tapped DataRobot to estimate retail demand in Brazil, while United Airlines wanted to predict which passengers might gate-check bags. Antoher one was the Philadelphia 76ers, used its system to improve its modeling process for season-ticket renewals. [11]

Below some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success:
Scalability and market penetration
Number of customers - Expand but always serve top tier clients
User engagement and retention - Retain top talent which is the backbone of a company
Profits - Key figure to determine the future of the company
Merger and acquisitions - Allows for Expansion
Amount of funding and investments - Signifies the confidnce the market has on your company
Number of Employees and also the motivation and well being of the workforce

The company closed its fiscal year ending in 2023 with $226 million of revenue, raised over $1 billion in total funding and its valued at $6.3 billion. [12]

## Recommendations

If i was in a position to advise DataRobot i would say: 

- While DataRobot brands itself as an end-to-end AI platform, there are some features that are missing from its toolkit or are not as robust as the competition. Using one Competitor as an example such as Dataiku which offers customers a more flexible a full suite of data science tooling, including an IDE, a task orchestrator and vizualization tool in their packet. While DataRobot does not currently offer a data labeling product that could compete. [13]

- Prices of the product and services can't be found anywhere, this practice is not transparent and can drive away customers

- Hire the right person for the job, such as the top management that can take the company to the next level. There has been a lot of turmoil and change in CEO leadership in the short live of the company. Currently DataRobot as of September 2022 they have appointed their third CEO which has caused low morale in employees.

- Strategically plan all future acquisitions or mergers. The AI and AutoML space is highly competitive, with established tech giants and startups entering the market. DataRobot needs to continually innovate to stay ahead. Furthermore, the industry is susceptible to consolidation, with larger companies acquiring smaller ones. DataRobot could face threats from mergers and acquisitions that could impact its market share.

- With the increasing importance of ethics and transparency in AI, DataRobot has an opportunity to lead in AI governance and explainability. Developing robust tools for model interpretability, bias mitigation, and compliance with regulatory standards can set DataRobot apart in the market. This will be particularly crucial as governments and industries establish stricter guidelines for AI deployment.

By doing this, the company can:

- Use their cash in hand and revenues /resource wisely to allow further expansion
- Improve profitability 
- Become an expert and go-to solution on these specific sectors
- Achieve a thorough understanding of the market, competitors and most importantly their clients.

DataRobot should rely on the expertise of financial advisors and tech-giants who have already paved the way to success.
